The style written here is the latest style. Don't bother with any code/file/folder that are not following this guide yet. That means they are legacy system.

## File

- each file has max 300 lines
- in repo module, write class for each table/for repo. ex:
  location/building.go -> interface: separate command and query
  location/building_impl.go -> implementation of the interface
